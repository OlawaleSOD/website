			<h5>Deeper Insights</h5>
			<h2>Working backwards from Perfect</h2>
			<p>Before I could jump into designing, it was important to define success and understand the health of the pickup experience at scale.</p>
			<p>Prior to the redesign, <span class="italics">contact rate</span> i.e the rate at which a phone call occurs during the pickup was the only proxy we had used to measure pickup quality.</p>
			<p>I unpacked the concept of the <span class="italics">perfect pickup</span> and modeled for the dimensions of time, space and anxiety.</p>
			<p>I partnered with our data scientist and used this framework to investigate the pickup health around the world.</p>

			<h5>How we got there</h5>
			<h2>Perfect the pickup for everyone, everywhere</h2>
			<p>Three primary questions informed my design strategy:</p>	
			<ol>
				<li>How do you design for everyone, everywhere?</li>
				<li>What contexts need to be considered?</li>
				<li>What’s the perfect pickup?</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Early on, it was important to understand the different factors that may influence the Rider and Driver experience. I mapped all the possible concepts and translated this into the <span class="italics">spectrums and situations</span> framework.</p>

			<h3>A more inclusive design</h3>
			<p>The existing Uber app was poorly designed for users who weren’t reflections of people that work in the San Francisco Uber office. To move beyond the existing biases, I tried to educate the team with an approach to designing for everyone, everywhere.
			</p>
			<p>The <span class="italics">spectrums</span> attempt to highlight the range of temporary or permanent challenges to consider when a person is interacting with Uber.</p>
			<p>The <span class="italics">situations</span> attempt to highlight situational challenges that everyone experiences. A situation is a temporary context that affects the way any person interacts with Uber for a short time.</p>

			<p>This framing was used to destroy any stereotypes that the team had about people and marketplaces. The goal was to create design solutions that scale and extend to any combination of these contexts from the outset.</p>

			<p>Instead of starting with a San Francisco-centric design and degrading for what the team deemed as the other challenging marketplaces we needed to start with a minimum bar of quality to enable rides for people in all contexts.</p>
			<p>The framework helped shift from unproductive questions like “How is this going to degrade for Nairobi?” to “How might we enable a destination first design for cities without a traditional addressing system?”</p>

			<h3>Working Backwards from Perfect</h3>
			<p>I reversed the polarity of the imperfect pickup to jumpstart creativity. Four key design challenges emerged:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>How might we better understand where the Rider is?</li>

			<h5>From Inaccurate to Precise</h5>
			<h2>Better Understanding Where the Rider Is</h2>
			<p>A major reason problematic pickups occurred were because getting an Uber relied heavily on the Rider explicitly setting a precise pickup location to meet. Not doing so, causes the Driver to be sent to the default device location, which half the time is wildly inaccurate.</p>
			<p>Our data revealed that:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>50% of Riders globally don't explicitly set a pickup location.</li>
				<li>Half of all sessions are at least 100m inaccurate.</li> 
				<li>45% of sessions have an improved GPS accuracy by the time of request. We do nothing with this information.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Based on these insights, I proposed two key feature ideas <span class="italics">Destination First</span> and <span class="italics">Live Locations</span> to help better understand where the Rider is. Central to the features, were these key ideas:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Stop relying on the Rider setting their pickup location. Do the heavy lifting on behalf of the Rider.</li>
				<li>Carve out more time for the GPS to warm up.</li>
				<li>Capitalize on GPS updates for as long as possible.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Starting at the end</h3>	
			<p>In order to optimize the pickup experience, there was only one thing we needed to know&#8212;the Rider's destination.</p>
			<p>Without much debate, the team agreed that asking “Where to?” upon app launch matched the mental of the Rider. It was also useful in unlocking more advantages, such as providing the user with upfront fares, estimated arrival times and allowing more time for the device GPS to warm up to aid the pickup experience.</p>
			<p>To compensate for the new speed bump, I designed the <span class="italics">accelerators</span> feature&#8212;a predictive set of shortcuts that gives the Rider 1-tap access to their most likely destinations at any given time.</p>
		</div>

			<h3>De-risking the new flow</h3>
			<p>We feared that the new destination first experience would cause issues because it was more friction and a fundamentally different flow.</p>
			<p>In order to de-risk some of our assumptions, we travelled to Bangalore, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Guangzhou and Shanghai to test an early prototype of the designs.</p>
			<p>To our surprise, not a single participant noticed the different sequencing of the flow or had trouble with it. The destination <span class="italics">accelerators</span> resonated well with participants, confirming our intuition around designing for speed.</p>

			<h3>Live Locations</h3>
			<p>Live locations feature was born by questioning whether we needed to default to any pickup location at all.</p>
			<p>Rather than lock on the Rider's location upon app launch (which roughly 12-15 seconds for an accurate fix), the app continues sensing, asynchronously updating as the GPS updates. The most accurate GPS location is obtained at the last possible moment&#8212;at the time of request.</p>
			<p>This required a big design shift for the posture of the experience. The challenge was shifting from <span class="italics">set your pickup</span> to <span class="italics">where and how do you want to go?</span></p>

			<h3>Inspiring confidence on the confirmation screen</h3>
			<p>If the new experience was to do the heavy lifting on behalf of the Rider, the confirmation screen needed to inspire confidence and show how the pickup experience was being taken care of.</p>
			<p>A key design challenge was to consider how much emphasis should be given to this always sensing state.</p>
			<p>The riskier design decisions I made was to obfuscate the pickup location entirely during the core app flow. The idea was to present the overview of the trip to persuade Riders to focus on selecting how they wanted to get there, rather on where to get picked up— since Uber would take care of that.</p>
			<p>This meant the UI needed to inspire confidence for the majority, and those who wanted to assert control needed to know how to discover the feature. It also meant that when we couldn’t optimize on the users behalf, we needed to occasionally ask the user for help.</p>

			<h3>Over-designing for anxiety</h3>
			<p>The goal of these designs were to reveal the accuracy of the GPS location as it resolved. I assumed that transparency was the key to building Rider trust. After testing many iterations of this experience, we repeatedly observed that:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Ambiguity and resolution concepts were mostly missed.</li>
				<li>Riders assumed that the app knew their current location and didn’t actively look to confirm.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Riders were not anxious or thinking about the GPS accuracy at all. My anxiety, further compounded by stakeholder feedback was being reflected in my designs. The GPS dot and location tooltips were loaded with this anxiety and I felt like I had exhausted all possibilities.</p>
			<p>After the third round of poor testing, I killed the idea in favor of a more simplified and balanced interface that reflected what Riders were focussed on.</p>

			<h2>Giving Riders and Drivers back their time</h2>
			<p>Knowing the Rider’s destination and the most accurate understanding of their location allowed us to <span class="italics">do the heavy lifting</span> and select the most optimal pickup location. The system needed to be smart enough to <span class="italics">just work</span> when it could, and humble enough to intervene when it couldn't. This system called <span class="italics">adaptation</span> was by far the most complex problem of this project.</p>
			<p>Foundational to the adaptation framework were these concepts:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>A confidence score would determine whether to choose a spot on behalf of the user, or to disambiguate their location. How we calculated this confidence score would be an ongoing project to improve.</li>
				<li>We needed to respect Rider control and agency. Design patterns needed to allow for opting in, opting out or taking complete control.</li>
				<li>The system needed to be flexible enough to learn about Rider willingness. Don't design based on the assumption we will know the right answer.</li>

			<h3>Intelligent pickups</h3>
			<p>Making trips efficient required that we move beyond dispatching the closest car, to dispatching the most optimal* car. This presented several design challenges:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Getting the Rider to walk to a nearby pickup location.</li>
				<li>Creating heuristics to decide the optimal spot.</li>
				<li>Adapting when we don’t know where the Rider is</li>

			<h3>Adaptation - a flexible architecture</h3>
			<p>I designed the flow based on the idea of a location confidence score. If Uber is confident of the Rider's location, it does all the heavy lifting. Otherwise, the app prompts the Rider to validate their location.</p>
			<p>Instead of designing for the right answer, I designed a flexible system optimized for learning and optionality.</p>

			<h5>From Ambiguous to Obvious</h5>
			<h2>Communicating location in a more intuitive way</h2>
			<p>A critical part of the rendezvous experience is that Riders and Drivers have a clear understanding of where to meet and how to get there. The existing Uber app didn’t do a good job of supporting wayfinding, relying mostly on street addresses and the map.</p>
			<p>During our research trip in India, we observed many wayfinding challenges. Limited street signage, intense traffic on the roads and sidewalks and poor GPS accuracy meant that the Riders and Drivers used POIs to coordinate their pickup location (in spite of what was formed in the app).</p>
			<p>We found that there were structural patterns inherent in their communication, which inspired the Geotalker feature.</p>

			<h3>Geotalker</h3>
			<p>Geotalker is a place description framework that mirrors how the human mind organizes spatial knowledge. It works by using a set of heuristics to translate a reverse geocoded street address into a <span class="italics">place description</span> phrase to support wayfinding, spatial awareness and communication.</p>
			<p>I started out by creating a concept model for wayfinding and spatial cognition. The exercise helped me come up with the idea that features of the urban environment could have different levels of salience, depending on the point of view of the Rider or Driver.</p>
			<p>The larger vision was to create a system where place description leveraged the POI with the highest level of salience, based primarily on heading direction and other factors. The system would test different labels and self-optimize based on the quality of the pickup experience.</p>
			<p>However, given the speculative nature of the idea and reliance on a quality location data set, we decided to experiment with a less intelligent version in the existing app.</p>

			<h3>Geotalker reduced ambiguity in the pickup experience</h3>
			<p>Early experiments resulted in significant decreases in the distance between pickup request location and actual pickup location and contact rate. We concluded that Geotalker helped to reduce ambiguity of the pickup location.</p>
			<p>This was enough signal necessary to launch the idea in the redesign.</p>

			<h2>The Most Radical Update Since 2012</h2>
			<p>In the 5 months after my involvement on the project, the team continued to evolve and polish the visual design, as well as finesse the finer functional details as the app was being built. Although I was not part of this process, it was great to see most of my work brought to life.</p>
			<p>On November 2nd, 2016 the new Rider app launched globally—an impressive achievement by the team, considering that it was a complete redesign and rebuild from scratch.</p>

			<h5>The Impact</h5>
			<h2>Positive results and much more to do</h2>
			<p>The redesign of the Uber Rider app on iOS and Android has had a positive impact on the pickup experience, at the time of writing (3 months since launch). However, <span class="italics">contact rate</span> has not been significantly decreased which means Riders and Drivers continue to contact each other to confirm or coordinate pickup details. I believe this to be a behavior change that will reveal over a longer period of time.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><h3>The error distance between requested pickup location and actual pickup location decreased by 34%</h3></li>
				<li><h3>Driver wait-time decreased by 20%</h3></li>
				<li><h3>High-precision pickup rates increased by 17%</h3></li>
				<li><h3>Multi-contact rate decreased by 3%</h3></li>
			</ul>
